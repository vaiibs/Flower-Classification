# Flower-Classification

This project builds a flower detection website using machine learning techniques to classify flowers such as 'daisy,' 'dandelion,' 'rose,' 'sunflower,' and 'tulip.' It involves building a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, training it with a flower image dataset, and creating a web application using Streamlit to serve the predictions and provide a user interface.
